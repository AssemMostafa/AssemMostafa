# Currency Chart Task

Getting Data: 
1- I have a problem with reteriving data beacause there is no dictionry but two nested arrays, so that was first problem beacuse i had to edit network layer. 
2- I used map to get array from NSArray then i got dictionry of array so i can show the chart from data. 
3- There are three parameters for the web service function, type of currency is okay but there are no UI for limit and interval so there are static data for me. you can change them in Currency Details ViewController. 

 UI: 
 There were no problem in the design except when discover properties for CandleStick ChartView and i tried to get close enough to the wanted design.

 Note:
